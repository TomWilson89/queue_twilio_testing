Search fifo and lifo

In python we use this process as lists:

q = [1,2,3,4,5]

FIFO = First In First Out--> delete the first one of the list
If we were using fifo method, we would have to look for the first value to be input and also the first to go out or be processed.

If using lifo method we would have to look for the last one of the input and be the first one to be processed.
LIFO = Last in Last Out --> delete the last one of the list

To do this, we would be working
